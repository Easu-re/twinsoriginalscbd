                  No. Many people confuse CBD oil with hemp seed oil. They are
                  very different from each other. Standard hemp seed oil is made
                  by cold pressing the seeds of the hemp plant. This oil is rich
                  in nutrients but does not contain any CBD or any other
                  cannabinoid. CBD oil is made from the flowers of the female
                  hemp plant without seeds. The resinous oil is extracted from
                  the plant using state of the art extraction methods to collect
                  the cannabinoids and terpenes naturally found in the plant

                <p>
                  CBD isolate is refined from CBD crude oil into distillate,
                  which is then refined further into a crystal form. This
                  isolated cannabinoid can reach purity levels of 98-99.99% CBD,
                  leaving out any impurities, terpenes, flavanoids or any other
                  cannabinoids. Full spectrum CBD contains terpenes and
                  flavanoids from the hemp plant and usually tests at around
                  50-80% CBD. CBD isolate has a single effect and full spectrum
                  CBD will give more of an entourage effect.

                  CGMP means current good manufacturing practice. These are
                  regulations which have the force of law. They require
                  manufacturers, processors, and packagers of drugs, medical
                  devices, food, and blood, to take proactive steps to ensure
                  product safety and purity. CGMP regulations require a quality
                  approach to manufacturing. It helps companies minimize or
                  eliminate instances of contamination and error. This protects
                  the consumer from purchasing a product which is not effective
                  or even dangerous. In our opinion, it is important to have any
                  product manufactured in a cGMP certified facility to ensure
                  customer safety and satisfaction.

              <h2>How is your CBD oil extracted?</h2>
              <p>
                The process for CBD extraction includes carbon dioxide and
                ethanol. Each process refines the oil down to its purest form
                leaving no residual solvents, heavy metals, bacteria or
                pesticides.

                What is the difference between CBD isolate and full spectrum CBD
                oil?
              </h2>
              <p>
                CBD isolate is refined from CBD crude oil into distillate, which
                is then refined further into a crystal form. This isolated
                cannabinoid can reach purity levels of 98-99.99% CBD, leaving
                out any impurities, terpenes, flavanoids or any other
                cannabinoids. Full spectrum CBD contains terpenes and flavanoids
                from the hemp plant and usually tests at around 50-80% CBD. CBD
                isolate has a single effect and full spectrum CBD will give more
                of an entourage effect.

              <h2>What is cGMP certified? Is it important?</h2>
              <p>
                CGMP means current good manufacturing practice. These are
                regulations which have the force of law. They require
                manufacturers, processors, and packagers of drugs, medical
                devices, food, and blood, to take proactive steps to ensure
                product safety and purity. CGMP regulations require a quality
                approach to manufacturing. It helps companies minimize or
                eliminate instances of contamination and error. This protects
                the consumer from purchasing a product which is not effective or
                even dangerous. In our opinion, it is important to have any
                product manufactured in a cGMP certified facility to ensure
                customer safety and satisfaction.
